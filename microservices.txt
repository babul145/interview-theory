//Martin Fowler
The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms.

//Gartner
A microservice is a service-oriented application component that is tightly scoped, strongly encapsulated, loosely coupled, independently deployable and independently scalable

"Microservices are a method of developing software applications which are made up of independently deployable, modular services"

//Drawback of Monolithic Architecture
- Performance issue due to huge data
- Continuous deployment not possible
- Adopting new technologies will be difficult
- Exception propagation not proper
- Code readable is not there
